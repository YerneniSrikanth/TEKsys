# TEKsys
##These are the Steps followed by me##
First created an amazon ec2 instance and installed docker on it.
Created a sample docker and html file 
I have taken the base image as Ubuntu and had run Apache aslo exposed port 80.
After the creation of Docker File I have built the docker image,published and mapped port 80 of the host to container.
You can access the webapplication running on my amazon using ec2-34-229-147-194.compute-1.amazonaws.com
If you want to run the image on your machine you can fork my git url and run it by mapping the ports.
